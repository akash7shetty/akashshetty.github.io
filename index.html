<p > Hello guys, </p >

So, before I take you through my study tools and tips I wish you all the very best for all your future endeavors.(Connect with me at my Portfolio-> <a href="https://akash7shetty.github.io/Portfolio/">www.akashshetty.com</a>) </p >
<p > So, let me give a short and crisp introduction to the company that I'm joining. <b>COHESITY</b> is a company which solves the data fragmentation issues the clients are facing and has won many recognizable awards internationally. It had visited our campus for placements on my birthday i.e. 20 July 2021(Though I was born at 2000). </p >

<p ><b><u> Interview Process: </u></b></p >

<p > -Pre - Placement talk for the shortlisted students from the online test (26th August 2021 in Zoom) </p >
<p > -1st Interview and 2nd Interview[2nd Sept 2021] </p >
<p > -Results announced [3rd Sept 2021] </p >
<p > And now the part that you've been waiting for:- </p >
<p > So, I was in the beginning of my 4th year and our college On-Campus placements had started. I had pretty good grades(9.15 CGPA) and I was an intermediate level coder. I didn't have much knowledge about placements and when the companies were bring in their drive I started applying for them. I got rejected in TEKsystems and Nutanix in intermediate interviews (It's OKAY to get rejected). Now, that I got rejected in 2 companies that lit the cigar in me, I sensed fear for the first time and that really made me focus. </p >
<p > And then came Cohesity for the role I've always been waiting for. I along with 182 of my batchmates applied for the drive and prepared for the aptitude rounds. We had our Online aptitude test on 22nd Aug 2021 and on 25th we were given the shortlist. Only 13 people were shortlisted including me. We shortlisted students had a pre-placement talk on 26th August. During this talk when the Q&amp;A session began, I asked 2-3 questions in between( This is very important â€¦You'll know why as you read). Then we waited for the interview dates to be announced( Waiting was the Worst part). Finally we got to know that our interview was supposed to be on 2nd Sept 2021. I was preparing completely for all the remaining time that I had(I'll share the study tools below). On 2nd September morning 9.40 am I had my first round and then few people were qualified for the next round including me. I had my second round at 12.35pm and it lasted up to 1.15pm. After this I really felt nervous and scared to be honest. On 3rd September in the evening we got to know that only 3 students were selected in our college. I was one of them and I am really thankful for my parents along with my family and friends for their support. I am really grateful to GOD! </p >
